## Synopsis

<%= action.description %>

The maintenance workflow is depicted in the following state diagram:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  UserScripts: User Scripts

  Prepare: prepare-script
  Check: check-script
  Change: change-script
  Verify: verify-script
  Commit: commit-script

  MergeChanges: Merge the changes to the target branch

  state check_if_state <<choice>>
  state user_scripts_if_state <<choice>>

  state UserScripts {
    [*] --> Prepare
    Prepare --> Check

    Check --> check_if_state
    check_if_state --> [*]: exit_code = 0
    check_if_state --> Change: exit_code ≠ 0

    Change --> Verify
    Verify --> Commit
    Commit --> [*]
  }

  UserScripts --> user_scripts_if_state
  user_scripts_if_state --> [*]: Failure
  user_scripts_if_state --> MergeChanges: Success
```

If any
script other than `check-script` exits with a non-zero exit code, it will cause
the action to fail.

## Inputs

Variables ending with the suffix `-script` can either be a file path to a script
or a multi-line string that starts with a shebang line.

## Building Blocks

This action is very opinionated and may not be suitable for all use cases.
If you need more flexibility, you can use the building blocks of this
action to create your own custom action. The building blocks are:

- [run-path-or-script](../run-path-or-script)
- [configure-git](../configure-git)
- [merge-commits](../merge-commits)

## Example Usage

Suppose we want to automatically update the version of Node.js in the
[`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc) file located in the root of the
repository (this is just a contrived example). Here's an example workflow to do
that using this action:

```yaml
name: update-nvmrc

on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  update-nvmrc:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@main
      - uses: fardjad/my-actions/automatic-maintenance@main
        with:
          prepare-script: |
            #!/usr/bin/env bash

            set -euo pipefail

            cp .nvmrc ${{ runner.temp }}/old-nvmrc
            curl -s https://registry.npmjs.org/node | jq -r '.["dist-tags"]["latest"]' > "${{ runner.temp }}/new-nvmrc"
          check-script: |
            #!/usr/bin/env bash

            set -euo pipefail

            current_version="$(cat .nvmrc)"
            new_version="$(cat ${{ runner.temp }}/new-nvmrc)"

            [ "$current_version" == "$new_version" ] || exit 1
          change-script: |
            #!/usr/bin/env bash

            set -euo pipefail

            cp "${{ runner.temp }}/new-nvmrc" .nvmrc
          verify-script: |
            #!/usr/bin/env bash

            # For this example, we don't need to do anything here. 
            # We can also omit this input altogether.
            exit 0
          commit-script: |
            #!/usr/bin/env bash

            set -euo pipefail

            old_version="$(cat ${{ runner.temp }}/old-nvmrc)"
            new_version="$(cat .nvmrc)"

            git add .nvmrc
            cat <<EOF | git commit -F -
            Update Node.js version in .nvmrc

            From ${old_version} to ${new_version}
            EOF
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
```
